Welcome to the Titanic Survival Prediction Project. This project utilizes machine learning to forecast passenger survival aboard the Titanic. With a dataset encompassing critical passenger details, we embark on a journey to explore, analyze, and predict survival outcomes, demonstrating the power of data science and predictive modeling in a real-world scenario.

## Problem Statement
## Task 1 | TITANIC SURVIVAL PREDICTION

   - Use the Titanic dataset to build a model that predicts whether a
    passenger on the Titanic survived or not. This is a classic beginner
    project with readily available data.
    
   - The dataset typically used for this project contains information
    about individual passengers, such as their age, gender, ticket
    class, fare, cabin, and whether or not they survived.

### Introduction:
Our Titanic Survival Prediction project employs machine learning to predict passenger survival on the Titanic. This beginner-level project utilizes the Titanic dataset, encompassing details such as age, gender, ticket class, fare, cabin, and survival status.

### Data Exploration and Analysis:
We began by exploring and visualizing the data. Notable insights include:

The majority did not survive (0: Died, 1: Survived).
Age distribution revealed a range of passenger ages.
Male passengers outnumbered females.
Fare distribution exhibited varying ticket prices.
Most passengers belonged to the third ticket class (Pclass).

### Data Preprocessing:
We prepared the data by:

Removing unnecessary columns, such as 'Name', 'Ticket', 'PassengerId', 'Parch', and 'Cabin.'
Handling missing values in 'Age' and 'Embarked.'
Encoding categorical variables 'Sex' and 'Embarked.'

### Model Training and Evaluation:
We used logistic regression to build our predictive model. After splitting the data into training and testing sets, our model achieved an accuracy of [insert accuracy percentage].

### Conclusion:
In conclusion, our Titanic Survival Prediction project demonstrated the application of machine learning and data analysis. We visualized key insights, preprocessed the data, and successfully predicted passenger survival. The model's accuracy reflects its effectiveness in binary classification.

### Future Directions:
Future work may involve exploring other machine learning algorithms, fine-tuning hyperparameters, and expanding feature engineering.

## **Problem Statement** | **Task 2 | MOVIE RATING PREDICTION WITH PYTHON**
 - Build a model that predicts the rating of a movie based on
  features like genre, director, and actors. You can use regression techniques to tackle this problem.

 - The goal is to analyze historical movie data and develop  a model that accurately estimates the rating given to a movie by users or critics.

 - Movie Rating Prediction project enables you to explore  data analysis, preprocessing, feature engineering, and  machine learning modeling techniques. It provides insights  into the factors that influence movie ratings and allows  you to build a model that can estimate the ratings of  movies accurately.

## **Task 2: Title: Movie Rating Prediction with Python**


Welcome to the Movie Rating Prediction project, where we harness the power of Python and its libraries to analyze and predict movie ratings. We dive into the IMDbMoviesIndia dataset, exploring its features and conducting data preprocessing, visualization, and model building to forecast movie ratings.

### **Python Libraries Utilized**

numpy for numerical operations.
pandas for data manipulation and analysis.
seaborn and matplotlib for data visualization.
sklearn for model selection, data splitting, and evaluation.
LinearRegression for building the predictive model.
mean_squared_error for model evaluation.

### **Data Exploration**
We commence with data exploration:

Checking for missing values reveals that we have some.
Visualization of missing data is presented via a heatmap.
Duplicate data is checked and removed.
We convert data types for 'Votes,' 'Year,' and 'Duration' to the appropriate numeric formats.

### **Analysis and Visualization**
We analyze the dataset, finding the movie with a runtime of 120 minutes or more.
The year with the highest average voting is identified.
Visualizations, such as a bar plot showcasing the number of movies per year and a heatmap to explore correlations, are presented.

### **Data Preprocessing**
Unnecessary columns like 'Name,' 'Genre,' 'Actor 1,' 'Actor 2,' 'Actor 3,' and 'Director' are dropped.
Data is split into training and testing sets.

### **Model Building and Evaluation**
We opt for a linear regression model for rating prediction.
The model is trained and evaluated using the root mean squared error (RMSE).
Predictions are made for movie ratings.

### **Future Directions**
In the future, we can enhance this project by incorporating more advanced machine learning techniques, feature engineering, and exploring other datasets to improve prediction accuracy. Moreover, user interfaces could be developed to make rating predictions more user-friendly.

### **Conclusion**
The Movie Rating Prediction project showcases the capabilities of Python in data analysis and predictive modeling. By leveraging various libraries and techniques, we have demonstrated how to forecast movie ratings based on key attributes, opening doors to further enhancements and applications in the realm of movie recommendations and analysis.
